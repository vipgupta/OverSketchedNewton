# OverSketchedNewton
This repo implements OverSketched Newton and other algorithms that can be used for fast large-scale convex optimization on serverless systems

It trains large-scale logistic regression on serverless systems (AWS Lambda) using the serverless computing framework developed in pywren. Running these files would require the pywren (http://pywren.io/) and the numpywren (https://github.com/Vaishaal/numpywren) packages to be installed.

The training data can be generated synthetically or can be real-world downloaded from here https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/
